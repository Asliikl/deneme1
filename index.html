Topics that are presented include: searching the literature for possible resources, writing the literature review section of the manuscript, deciding on statistical methods, writing the discussion section of the manuscript, selection of a journal to submit the manuscript, the process of contacting the editor, undertaking a revision based on reviewers’ feedback, and resubmitting the manuscript. Working with a mentor through a professional organization or collaborating with a colleague who is competent in English is discussed as alternative ways of achieving a publication in English.
